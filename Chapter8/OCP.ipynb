    "# The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "* The OCP is all about allowing change, but doing it without requiring you to modify existing code. Here’s how we   usually define the OCP:\n",
    "* Open-Closed Principle:Classes should be **open for extension,and closed for modification**.\n",
    "OCP is really a combination of encapsulation and abstraction.\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "* E.g.InstrumentSpec is closed for modification; the matches() method is defined in the base class\n",
    "and doesn’t change.But it’s open for extension, because all of the subclasses can change the behavior of matches()\n",
    "![](./img/OCP.png)\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### OCP step by step\n",
    "1. We coded matches() in InstrumentSpec. java, and closed it for modification.\n",
    "2. But we needed to modify matches() to work with instrument-specific spec classes\n",
    "3. So we **extended** InstrumentSpec, and **overrode** matches() to change its behavior\n"
