// Architecture is your design structure, and highlights the //* most important
// parts of your app,
// and the //*relationships between those parts
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// It’s awfully hard to talk about the relationships between parts of a system
// if
// you don’t have any of the parts themselves
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// The things in your application that are really important are architecturally
// significant, and you should focus on them FIRST.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// !The three Qs of architecture
// (When you’re trying to figure out if something is architecturally
// significant)
// 1.Is it part of the essence of the system?
// The essence of a system is what it is at its //* most basic level.
// “If this feature wasn’t implemented, would the system still really be what
// it’s supposed to be?”
// 2. What the fuck does it mean?
// Anytime you’re unsure about what something is, it could take lots of time, or
// create problems with the rest of the system. Spend time on these features
// early, rather than late
// 3. How the “heck” do I do it?
// If you have no idea how you’re going to tackle a particular problem, you
// better spend some time up front looking at that feature, so it doesn’t create
// lots of problems down the road.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// The reason that these features are architecturally significant is that they
// all introduce RISK to your project. It doesn’t matter which one you start
// with—as long as you are working towards reducing the RISKS in succeeding.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//Sometimes the best way to write great code is to hold off on writing code as
//long as you can.Plan, organize, architect, understand requirements,reduce risks
//all these make the job of actually writing your code very simple.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// You can use these three basic steps anytime you’re unsure about what a feature means
//1.Ask the customer
//2.Commonality analysis
//3.Implementation plan
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//When you find more things that are different about a feature than things that
//are the same, //! there may not be a good,generic solution
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// Customers don’t pay you for great code, they pay you for great software.
